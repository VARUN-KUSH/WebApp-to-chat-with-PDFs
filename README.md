**Over all Architecture of this project**

**User sends file to Backend**
**Storing files on server(this makes process slow so if you want to optimize your chat app remove the writing text file and saving file on server (both pdf fille and text file will be save din public/temp folder))**
**Sending File to Cloudinary(cloudinary is free so in case you are testing it's great for that) similar to bucket S3 **
